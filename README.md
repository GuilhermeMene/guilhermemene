## Hello!
#### I'm Guilherme Mene Ale Primo
##### Consultant at *gMap - Geology and Geotechnology* [gmapgeo.com](https://gmapgeo.com)

I'm a geologist with exploration experience involving gold, copper, and nickel projects.
In my career, I've always been interested in how technology can help me with "geologic" problems by building my own diversified apps.

I am a doctoral student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), working with the petrology of mafic rocks. However, due to the dynamicity of life, I've decided to explore a new trail in my career, learning more about IT and new technologies. The turning point was when I realized I spent more time coding than working on geology. I'm currently following the Data Science roadmap to improve my skills and achieve my new targets.

#### My current works and active repo's:

1. QAQCMin - An open source QAQC software for geology and exploration projects;
2. bbot - A Binance Bot for Spot Trading BTC-USDT using a Raspeberry Pi;
3. ***Unamed yet*** - An open source geophysical software for processing the GeoSGB raw XYZ data (local dev).
4. DBExp - A geology exploration database software; <img src="icons/lock.svg" width="20" height="20">
