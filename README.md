## Hello!
#### I'm Guilherme Mene Ale Primo
##### Consultant at *gMap - Geology and Geotechnology* [gmapgeo.com](gmapgeo.com)

I'm a geologist with exploration experience involving gold, copper, and nickel projects.
In my career, I've always been interested in how technology can help me with "geologic" problems by building my own diversified apps.

I am a doctoral student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), working with the petrology of mafic rocks. However, due to the dynamicity of life, I've decided to explore a new trail in my career, learning more about IT and new technologies. The turning point was when I realized I spent more time coding than working on geology. I'm currently following the backend and DevOps roadmap to achieve my new targets.
